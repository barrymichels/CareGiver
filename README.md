# CareGiver

[Human content]
This is the only text I have provided for this project. The rest was generated by AI (including the commit messages).
This is a project to allow our family to manage the care giving schedule for our elderly parents.
It was built in just a few days as a way to fill a need and to learn how to utilize AI in app development.
It will grow and change as we use it and see how the app can be improved.
